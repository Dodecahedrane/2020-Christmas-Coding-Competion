# Fractal Christmas Tree In Python
## Year 1 Comp Sci Christmas Coding Competition Entry

For the 2020 coding competition I decided to set myself a challenge; make a recursively drawn Christmas tree in Python using only the spare time I had on Christmas day. And to do it in under 20 lines.

I technically managed both of those, however it looks more like a palm tree, so I guess I better hope the judges are Hawaiian. Although even their Christmas trees look more like a Christmas tree than mine! At least though I came in exactly on my 20 line goal, so I suppose I succeeded in that requirement.  You can see bellow my fractal tree compared to a Christmas Palm tree, and well, its a little underwhelming to say the least.

Originally I made this using the Tkinter Python library but I found out at around 9pm or so that it really really wasn't suited to trying to recursively draw fractals. I mean you can do it... But it isn't pretty (or under my 20 line goal). So I switched to Turtle which was a joy to use comparatively, but by that time I was tired from the amount of food I had, so never got it working before the midnight cut off.
