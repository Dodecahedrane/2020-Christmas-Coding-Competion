# Fractal Christmas Tree In Python
## Year 1 Comp Sci Christmas Coding Competition Entry

For the 2020 coding competition I decided to set myself a challenge; make a recursively drawn Christmas tree in Python using only the spare time I had on Christmas day. And to do it in under 20 lines.

I technically managed both of those, however it looks more like a palm tree, so I guess I better hope the judges are Hawaiian. Although even their Christmas trees look more like a Christmas tree than mine! At least though I came in exactly on my 20 line goal, so I suppose I succeeded in that requirement.
